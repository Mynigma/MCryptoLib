* A New Chapter in the Fight for Digital Rights

This very special EFFector is a letter from our new
executive director, Cindy Cohn

In 1993, EFF founder John Gilmore approached me with an
unusual proposition: he asked if I would serve as lead
outside attorney working with a fairly new
organization--the Electronic Frontier Foundation--on a case
challenging the U.S. export restrictions against
cryptography. Bernstein v. Department of Justice took over
seven years to work its way through the courts, but
eventually became the landmark case that first established
that computer code is a form of protected speech under the
First Amendment. It was a watershed moment for Internet
law, and for my life.

As Bernstein was entering its final phase, EFF's
newly-appointed Executive Director Shari Steele offered me
the job of legal director. It was the opportunity of a
lifetime. As legal director for the last 15 years, I've
worked on cases that ensured ongoing protection for civil
liberties in our increasingly digital, networked world. As
attacks materialized via copyright, patents, computer
security hysteria, electronic voting machines, and more, we
fought for digital freedom. This was all possible because
of the leadership of my dear friend and our executive
director of 15 years, Shari Steele.

Shari has accepted a role on EFF's board of directors, and
now I'm stepping up to fill her shoes as EFF's new
executive director. I want to share with you my vision for
the future of EFF's work, and how you can help us be even
stronger.

EFF is committed to a world where you are free to make your
voice heard, access information, participate in culture,
have a private conversation, join with others to make
political change, or develop cool technology--a world where
you're free to take advantage of the opportunities that
digital tools make available to more people than ever
before. Protecting privacy, free speech, association, and
innovation is how we can build and maintain that world.

Right now, our top objective is to end mass surveillance of
our digital communications by government agencies like the
NSA and ensure that the basic privacy and associational
rights--along with our security--are strengthened, even as
governments gain access to powerful new tracking tools. We
have ground-breaking lawsuits to fight this surveillance in
the courts, but we're also developing software to help you
regain control over your privacy and make the Internet more
secure. And because we have come to rely on platforms for
much of what we do on the Internet, we’re pushing
companies to make security features available and easy to
use. We’re working with partners around the world to
defend the privacy of people worldwide, including updating
national laws for the digital age and helping to bring
digital privacy issues before the United Nations. And we're
extending our focus to the surveillance that happens in the
streets, addressing the threats represented by
irresponsible implementations of facial recognition,
biometrics, license plate readers, and more.

Reining in surveillance is only possible with real
government transparency. That's why EFF is kicking off a
major campaign this year to fight against what is known as
over-classification, hiding documents away from the public.
This problem has plagued our democracy for years and
prevented reform in other areas. And we’ll continue our
transparency work in the courts, including using the
Freedom of Information Act and challenging overbroad
secrecy that too often accompanies government demands for
information about users.

As our lives have become increasingly digital, the greatest
free speech battles of our time have moved online. Over the
last few years, we've seen attacks on free speech dressed
up as fights over copyright policy, international trade
agreements, anonymity, and network neutrality. EFF intends
to stay on the cutting edge of the free speech fight,
ensuring that our rights to publish and access content will
be enhanced--not diminished--as our use of technology
grows. And through initiatives like our DRM-eradicating
Apollo 1201 Project, international copyright work, and
patent busting, we'll continue to protect our right to
innovate and enjoy remarkable new technologies.

For 15 years, I've helped guide and grow EFF's legal team,
and I'm deeply honored to have a chance to step into the
role of executive director. I may be at the helm, but the
organization's accomplishments are driven forward by the
hard work of our staff--attorneys, activists, and
technologists--who have dedicated their lives to defending
civil liberties.

But we don't do this alone. The heroes of this movement are
the more than 25,000 members joining us to fight for a
better digital future. We're grateful, and we’ve all been
lucky. As threats to our digital rights have grown, the
scope and profile of the digital rights movement has grown
to meet those challenges. Given what we're facing, I'd like
to see our membership double to match the emerging,
world-spanning hazards and ensure that we can continue to
combat them effectively.

Please join us in fighting for digital rights. We've got
major battles ahead, including a showdown in Congress over
NSA reform, major legal struggles around software patents,
surveillance, and copyright, and some extraordinary
technical projects. There are many essential ways to
participate and protect the future of privacy and free
speech: educate people about the importance of their
digital rights, speak out in our campaigns, and become a
donating member to strengthen this vital, future-focused
movement for users' rights worldwide:
