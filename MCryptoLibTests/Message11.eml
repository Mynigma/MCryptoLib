Dear all,

This Friday's OASIS seminar will be given by Alexandra Silva,
currently visiting from Radboud University Nijmegen. She will present
a formal approach to the description and analysis of networks. All are
welcome.

When and where: 2pm this Friday, Lecture Theatre B, Computer Science

NetKAT: A FORMAL SYSTEM FOR THE VERIFICATION OF NETWORKS

NetKAT is a relatively new programming language and logic for
reasoning about packet switching networks that fits well with the
popular software defined networking (SDN) paradigm. NetKAT was
introduced quite recently by Anderson et al. (POPL 2014) and further
developed by Foster et al. (POPL 2015). The system provides
general-purpose programming constructs such as parallel and sequential
composition, conditional tests, and iteration, as well as
special-purpose primitives for querying and modifying packet headers
and encoding network topologies. The language allows the desired
behavior of a network to be specified equationally. It has a formal
categorical semantics and a deductive system that is sound and
complete over that semantics, as well as an efficient decision
procedure for the automatic verification of equationally-defined
properties of networks.

Best wishes,
Jamie
